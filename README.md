Work in progress with Vancouver Community Network.

The index.html program calls main.js, 
which is a JavaScript program that plots two animated bar charts from the fields in PublicLibraries2011.csv (containing information on BC public libraries). 
It uses the JavaScript library http://d3js.org/ and is based on the example of bar chart.

The program displays a menu from which two options can be selected. 
This action plots the selected fields in two bar charts. 
The information in the fields is normalized and cleaned.
The name of the library is displayed when the mouse hoovers over one of the bars.
